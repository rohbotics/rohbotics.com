  <h3>Synopsis:</h3> <p> Now a high school student, I have interned at various robotics companies, including OLogic, OSRF, and Savioke. I am interested in almost all things electronic. Ever since I was a little kid, I have been fascinated by the gadgets and gizmos that surround us, and I am driven to understand how they work. My primary hobbies include robotics and amateur radio.
  <h3>Description:</h3>
  <p>I have been involved in robotics since I was 8 years old, when I started to build my first Arduino based robots. Since then I have expanded my horizons, learning how to utilize ROS (Robot Operating System) to create more capable robots, as well as learning PCB design to be able to make custom electronics.</p>
  <p>I got my Technician class amateur radio license at age 9, and my General class license a year later. I am involved with the ham club <a href="https://www.fars.k6ya.org/">FARS</a> and my local ARES/RACES chapter <a href="http://www.cupertinoares.org/index.php">CARES</a>.</p>
